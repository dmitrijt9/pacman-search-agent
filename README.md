# Pacman's Search Agent

Semestrial work of a course Artificial Inteligence (4IZ431) at Prague University of Economics and Business.

We have to choose two algorithms from [AI Berkeley Pacman's project](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) and implement them.

I chose DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithms in [P1 - Search section](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html).
